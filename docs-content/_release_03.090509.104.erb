<p class="note"><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Crunchy PostgreSQL for PCF v3 relies on functionality
released in PCF v1.9 – v1.12 to provide support for "on-demand broker" capability.<br><br>
To implement this functionality, Crunchy Data has made material modifications to the
Crunchy PostgreSQL for PCF manifest and does not currently provide a direct upgrade path from

To avoid confusion between the two implementations, Crunchy Data has removed the
Crunchy PostgreSQL for PCF v1 and v2 software versions from Pivotal Network.
