<%= vars.service_name_long -%> uses [pgBackrest](https://github.com/pgbackrest/pgbackrest) as a dedicated backup and archiving host.
The tile comes pre-configured with nightly physical backups of the database server:

| Day       | Backup Type | Time     |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Sunday    | Full        | 1 am UTC |
| Monday    | Incremental | 1 am UTC |
| Tuesday   | Incremental | 1 am UTC |
| Wednesday | Incremental | 1 am UTC |
| Thursday  | Incremental | 1 am UTC |
| Friday    | Incremental | 1 am UTC |
| Saturday  | Incremental | 1 am UTC |

Although backups only happen once a day, PostgreSQL is continuously shipping the Write-Ahead-Logs (WAL) to the pgBackrest server.
This means that point-in-time recovery is possible, regardless of the schedule.

These backups not only offer peace of mind, but are used frequently by the tile.
Crunchy PostgreSQL for PCF uses backups to create replicas in the stack.
By using backups in operations, we can ensure that backups and restores work.

All archives from the database server are stored on the dedicated backup host.
This means that databases can be restored to specific points in time.

Currently, individual databases cannot be restored. All databases are restored in the shared cluster.
